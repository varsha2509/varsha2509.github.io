excerpt: "Open source spatial inventory of air pollutant sequestration data by grassland and shrubland vegetation in the US. The dataset was developed using the [daily leaf area index of vegetation classes](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1210), the National Land Cover dataset, and the [i-Tree Eco model](http://www.itreetools.org/).
