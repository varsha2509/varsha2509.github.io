title: "[US County-Level Air Pollution Sequestration Dataset](http://varshg.com/county/County.html)"
excerpt: "I developed a county-level spatial inventory of air pollutant sequestration by grassland and shrubland vegetation in the US. The dataset was developing using the [daily leaf area index of vegetation classes](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1210), the National Land Cover dataset and the [i-Tree Eco model](http://www.itreetools.org/). The dataset developed in this work is currently used by 

1. California Department of Conservation and The Nature Conservancy in the [TerraCount tool](https://maps.conservation.ca.gov/terracount/) for land use planning. 

2. U.S. Department of Forest Service in the [i-Tree Eco tool](https://www.itreetools.org/support/resources-overview/i-tree-methods-and-files/i-tree-eco-resources)"
