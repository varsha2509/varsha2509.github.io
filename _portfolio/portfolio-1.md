title: "[Hyperlocal Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning in East Bay Area, CA](https://github.com/varsha2509/hyperlocal-aq-prediction)"
excerpt: "In this project, I developed machine learning models to predict air quality on a city-block basis in Oakland and San Leandro, CA, without having to rely on complex physical modeling. I used a wide variety of publicly available datasets such as previously measured pollutant concentrations, local meteorological data, emissions from local industrial sources, and traffic information. <br/> <br/> Check out my <a href='https://github.com/varsha2509/hyperlocal-aq-prediction' target='_blank'>github repo</a> and my <a href='https://varsha-gopalakrishnan.medium.com/hyperlocal-air-quality-prediction-using-machine-learning-ed3a661b9a71' target='_blank'>  blog post </a> on this work!<br/><br/><img src='/images/Image.png'>"
