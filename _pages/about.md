Hi! 

I am an environmental engineer/data scientist specializing in air quality and climate change modeling. I have strong expertise in machine learning, geographic information systems and working with geospatial data. I am passionate about having a positive impact on society by reducing greenhouse gases, promoting sustainable development and through environmental conservation. 

I am currently a Senior Air Quality Scientist at Ramboll, San Francisco, CA. I hold a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from The Ohio State Univeristy, a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from Anna University, India, and I am also pursuing a Data Science Bootcamp program through Springboard. I am originally from Chennai, India.
