Hey there, welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Varsha and I'm currently an environmental data scientist at Watershed. Previously, I was a senior full-stack data scientist at [The EVERY Company*](https://theeverycompany.com/). I have a strong background in both environmental science and data science, and Iâ€™m passionate about working on projects that merge these fields, particularly in the context of climate science. Prior to my role at EVERY, I worked as a senior consultant at Ramboll, where I specialized in air quality modeling and emissions estimation.
