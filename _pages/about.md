Hey there, welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Varsha and I'm currently a senior data scientist at [The EVERY Company*](https://theeverycompany.com/). I have a background in environmental science and chemical engineering, and I love working on data +  air quality, climate change, sustainability science. Before EVERY, I was working as a senior consultant at Ramboll, working on air quality modeling and emissions estimation.

I am passionate about using innovation and technology to tackle issues related to climate change and food security. I am a map geek, and you can find me scrolling through random digital maps, or building my own (yes, I love working with spatial data).
