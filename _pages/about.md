Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am an environmental engineer and data scientist specializing in air quality and climate change modeling. I am passionate about using innovation and technology to tackle issues related to climate change and food security. I have strong expertise in machine learning, geographic information systems and geospatial data, and thrive working in collaborative, cross-functional environments.

I am currently a Senior Air Quality Scientist at Ramboll, San Francisco, CA. I hold a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from The Ohio State Univeristy, a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from Anna University, India, and have completed a Data Science Bootcamp program with Springboard. I am originally from Chennai, India.
