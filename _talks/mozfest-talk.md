As a part of MozFest, Varsha and her colleague will lead an interactive discussion on how game design and data visualization can enable actionable AI/ML transparency that truly empower and enable the public through approachable public tools. Using a systems design lens, the session will examine how we can make data publications or other traditional methods of “transparency” more impactful with specific examples in health, employement and politics. This session will also give attendees a chance to share ideas and workshop how “Participatory Design” can work in data science.
